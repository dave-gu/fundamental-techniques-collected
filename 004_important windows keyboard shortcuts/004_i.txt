Win+E [open explorer]
Win+R [run]
Win+F [don't bother using windows search, get "everything search engine"]
Win+D [desktop]
Ctrl+Esc [open start menu]
Win + # [activate #th icon on taskbar]
Shift + Click on Taskbar Icon [open new instance of that program]
Ctrl + Click on Taskbar Icon
^[activate a window of a stacked taskbar icon without listing all windows and clicking]
You can also Win+Ctrl+#
Alt+Esc [send a window to the back]
Alt+Tab works in a certain way. the behavior of it is that
the first chosen window will be the most recent and the second chosen window
will be the second most recent etc. so if you have three programs you need to switch
between then you can elevate one towards the most recents and then keep hitting
alt and tab twice and releasing alt and that would cycle through three programs...

Alt+Space activates the Titlebar Right Click Menu which shows
[restore move size minimize maximize close]

an advanced technique to follow up with that is that you can try
Alt+Space, s, downarrow,rightarrow, and move the mouse,
which allows you to resize the window from the lower right corner without needing
to click drag. also you can resize the windows slowly or move them with the arrow keys
and cancel the movement or size with esc and confirm it with enter.

CtrlShiftEsc = open taskmgr

Another thing is that if you ShiftRightClick on the taskbaricons
you can select the classic stacked side by side and cascade options to rearrange windows.

Likewise the ShiftRightClick can allow you to Copy As Path a MultipleItemSelection of files from explorer.

*on multiple item selections:
hold ctrl to add or remove from the selection while single left clicking
^likewise you can hold ctrl and navigate with arrows and then hit space to activate items and thereby add/remove them
hold shift to add or remove from the selection in a range from the last item

If you hold CTRL while you open a folder in wexplorer it will open in a new window whereas normally it opens in the same.

Drag and Dropping files will copy if it is a different drive and move if it is the same drive.

Hodling alt while you drag and drop a file or folder will create a Shortcut

Shortcuts are a magical microsoft artifact where some kind of "distributed link tracking" service will monitor
the paths and update them if the destination moves...

in XP you used to be able to rearrange icons within a folder not according to the grid if the size was set to one of the icon sizes.
you can still have spatial navigation for icons in explorer in windows 7 if you can find the correct registry key to modify
to "enable full row select" but anyways if the folder falls out of MRU most recently used list, then those particular icon locations will be lost.

the MKLINK command line utility provided by microsoft can allow you to create a directory symbolic link which is like a shortcutted folder.

the drive letters that are assigned at startup by Windows can be set based on the drive Volume Serial Number
(for a new drive that has the same volume serial number as a previously connected drive)
i think that if for instance your C drive was 9351-56AA then you would need to apply that Volume Serial Number to the boot drive and likewise
that Volume Serial Number should not be on the original drive if it is still attached
if you are cloning your hard drive this is something that you need to consider but unfortunately i can't remember
all of the details at the moment.  don't know why i wanted to note this just now but I did!

here's a few more shortcuts
Alt+Printscreen [screenshot only teh active window]
Alt+F4 [close the active window]
Win+Pause/Break [opens a certain System pane in Control Panel]
