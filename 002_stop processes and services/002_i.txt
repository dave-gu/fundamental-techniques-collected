-we can use these microsoft sysinternals utilities by mark russinovich
in order to view processes.

msconfig
services.msc
%windir%\system32\taskschd.msc /s
-msconfig takes precedence over services.msc but they both do roughly the same thing.

there are also some utilities by nirs at the "nirsoft" website such as autoruns
that you can check out

sc
net
taskkill
- i will explain how to use these command line utilities.

first of all. they are located in the "Path" since c:\windows\system32 is in the path.
since they are in teh "path" their commands can be run from any location

try this unheard of procedure with me:
Win + E [open windows explorer]
Alt + D [focus location bar. you can also use Ctrl+L i think]
input "cmd /k sc query"
hit enter

this will open a new command prompt
which will not close after execution of the sc query command

now try this:
sc query > sc-query.txt [right caret pipes the output to the file]
type sc-query.txt [this echos the file contents to the prompt]
sc-query.txt [this executes the default .txt file program to open the file]

okay so that is one way you can look at the services using teh command line.

now let's cover net.exe
we can use net to stop services by writing "net stop "
followed by the short or long names that are given by the sc query.

net stop wuauserv

taskkill /f /im *update*

now to wrap up a command prompt session let's do
doskey /history > doskey-history.txt
