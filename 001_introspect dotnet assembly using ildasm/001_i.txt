001_introspect dotnet assembly using ildasm

we just started trying to utilize this XInputDotNet library.
https://github.com/speps/XInputDotNet

the documentation doesn't tell us what to do
other than the first step of adding the reference

let's see what is going on with XInputDotNetPure.dll
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/view-contents
this microsoft document indicates that you can target an executable [.exe]
using ildasm.exe to read the MSIL information in the file.
we know that the file is an assembly because the author has told us that.

here is the sequence of steps we used in order to execute
the task of opening the dll with the exe

Win+R [open run dialog]
"cmd" , enter
"cd /d " +[path-to-folder-containing-dll] , enter
Win+6 [activate currently open and pinned Everything.exe on taskbar]
"ildasm.exe"
at this point i see that i have 19 of these and i choose one in particular that i think should work
i left clicked it (this wasn't actually necessary)
shift + right-clicked it (you can also use "appskey")
activated copy as path
focus back on the cmd window
right click and paste the path
" xinputdotnetpure.dll" , enter

then you would see this: [[ildasm.exe-xinputdotnetpure.dll_.png]]
okay, that's it for this technique!
